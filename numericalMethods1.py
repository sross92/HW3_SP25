"""
The following functions are designed to integrate the Gaussian/Normal Probability Density Function using the 
Simpson 1/3 rule.
Characteristics of the GNPDF (or GPDF) are:
1.  It is symmetric about the mean.
2.  The area beneath the GNPDF equals 1.0.
3.  Integrating between some left limit x to some right limit x represents the probability that the continuous random
    variable x lies between the limits.
4.  68% of the area is between +/-1*StDev of the mean, 95.5% between +/-2*StDev of the mean.
